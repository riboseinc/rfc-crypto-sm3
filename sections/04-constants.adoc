== Constants $$T_j$$

When $$0 <= j <= 15$$:

[source]
----
T_j = 79cc4519
----

When $$16 <= j <= 63$$:

[source]
----
T_j = 7a879d8a
----

Selection of $$T_j$$ is based on considerations provided in
<<design-t>>.

== Boolean Functions $$FF_j$$ and $$GG_j$$

When $$0 <= j <= 15$$:

[source]
----
FF_j(X, Y, Z) = X xor Y xor Z
GG_j(X, Y, Z) = X xor Y xor Z
----

When $$16 <= j <= 63$$:

[source]
----
FF_j(X, Y, Z) = (X and Y) or (X and Z) or (Y and Z)
GG_j(X, Y, Z) = (X and Y) or (not(X) and Z)
----

Where X, Y, Z are 32-bit words.

Note that $$FF_j$$ and $$GG_j$$ are identical for $$0 <= j <= 15$$.
Design considerations of these boolean functions are detailed
in <<design-bool>>.


== Permutation Functions $$P_0$$ and $$P_1$$

[source]
----
P_0(X) = X xor (X <<< 9) xor (X <<< 17)
P_1(X) = X xor (X <<< 15) xor (X <<< 23)
----

Where X is a 32-bit word.

Design considerations of these permutation functions are detailed
in <<design-perm>>.
