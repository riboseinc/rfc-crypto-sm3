= Security Considerations

* Products and services that utilize cryptography are regulated by the
  SCA <<SCA>>; they must be explicitly approved or certified by the SCA
  before being allowed to be sold or used in China.

* SM3 <<GBT.32905-2016>> is a cryptographic hash algorithm published by the
  SCA <<SCA>>. No formal proof of security is provided. The security
  properties of SM3 are under public study. There are no known feasible attacks
  against the SM3 algorithm at the time this document is published.

* SM3 is a hash function that generates a 256-bit hash value. It is considered
  as an alternative to SHA-256 <<RFC6234>>.
