= Security Considerations

* Products and services that utilize cryptography are regulated by the OSCCA
  <<OSCCA>>; they must be explicitly approved or certified by the OSCCA before being
  allowed to be sold or used in China.

* SM3 <<GBT.32905-2016>> is a cryptographic hash algorithm published by the
  OSCCA <<OSCCA>>. No formal proof of security is provided. The security
  properties of SM3 are under public study. There are no known
  feasible attacks against the SM3 algorithm at the time this document is
  published.

* SM3 is a hash function that generates a 256-bit hash value. It is considered
  as an alternative to SHA-256 <<RFC6234>>.
